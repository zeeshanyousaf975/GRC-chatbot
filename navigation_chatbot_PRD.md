# Product Requirements Document: AI Navigation Chatbot

## 1. Product Overview

The AI Navigation Chatbot is a conversational interface that helps users navigate through a software platform based on their queries. The chatbot interprets user questions and directs them to the relevant section of the platform using a mindmap structure stored in a graph database.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1. Frontend
- React-based UI with chat interface
- Real-time response display
- Navigation links based on chatbot recommendations

### 2.2. Backend
- FastAPI framework for API endpoints
- LangChain for orchestration of AI components
- Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile model via GROQ API for natural language understanding
- Neo4j database for storing navigation structure
- Neo4j vector embeddings for semantic search

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. Natural Language Query Processing
- Accept free-form text queries about system navigation
- Process and understand user intent using Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile
- Match queries to relevant sections in the mindmap

### 3.2. Contextual Navigation Recommendations
- Generate relevant navigation paths based on user queries
- Provide direct links to appropriate sections
- Explain why particular recommendations are made

### 3.3. Knowledge Graph Integration
- Store mindmap data in Neo4j graph database
- Create relationships between navigation nodes
- Enable traversal of navigation paths

### 3.4. Vector Search
- Convert navigation nodes to vector embeddings
- Perform semantic search on user queries
- Return most relevant navigation options

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Database Schema
- Node types: Solution, Feature, Framework, Template
- Relationships: CONTAINS, RELATED_TO, PART_OF
- Properties: id, title, url, description, context

### 4.2. API Endpoints
- `/api/query`: Process natural language queries
- `/api/navigate`: Return navigation recommendations
- `/api/feedback`: Collect user feedback on responses

### 4.3. LangChain Components
- Document loader for mindmap data
- Text splitter for processing navigation nodes
- Vector store for embeddings
- Chain for query processing
- Agent for orchestrating responses

### 4.4. LLM Specifications
- Model: Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile via GROQ
- Context Window: 128K tokens
- Tool Use: Supported
- JSON Mode: Supported
- Estimated generation speed: ~275 TPS

### 4.5. Embeddings
- Neo4j vector embeddings for navigation nodes
- Semantic similarity search
- Context-aware retrieval

## 5. Data Flow

1. User submits navigation query through React UI
2. FastAPI endpoint receives query
3. LangChain processes query using Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile
4. Neo4j database is queried for relevant navigation nodes
5. Vector similarity search finds matching content
6. Response is formulated with navigation recommendations
7. Results returned to frontend with clickable navigation links

## 6. Implementation Plan

- Create navigation components
- Add user feedback mechanisms

### 6.4. Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Connect frontend to backend
- Test with sample queries
- Refine response quality
- Optimize performance

## 7. Evaluation Metrics

- Query understanding accuracy
- Navigation recommendation relevance
- Response time
- User satisfaction ratings

## 8. Extensions & Future Features
